 <title>Why go Lightweight?</title>
 <shortdesc>Full DITA has more power (and thus complexity) than is needed in some situations. LwDITA
  provides a slimmed-down alternative that users can author in the markup flavor of their choice â€“
  XML, Markdown, and HTML5.</shortdesc>

  <draft-comment author="Kristen J Eberlein" time="30 November 2016">
   <p>Good sentence that I think needs to be relocated elsewhere.</p>
   <p>LwDITA addresses those concerns and shifts with a simplified model that accommodates the needs
    of diverse groups of content creators while maintaining cross-format collaboration as a core
    design and implementation value.</p>
