This repository is mostly a selection of useful files drawn from the OASIS TCS's [official repository](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/dita-lwdita/). __Note__ that some items have been renamed or lightly modified, and therefore this is __not__ a proper fork or mirror.

The directories `Live_lw-(map|topic)` are made using version 1.4 of [LiveDTD](http://www.sagehill.net/livedtd/).

Initialised on 2018.03.08.Thu after a release for public review.
